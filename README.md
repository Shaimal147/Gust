# Gust
A weather forecast web-app. Built on MERN

This web app displays weather forecast data from an open source weather forecast API in a user friendly interface.

The API used is open meteo

App architecture is seperated into: 
- vite + react front end project
- express + mongoDB back end project

Node scripts to run both projects are already configured under the common 'dev' script (npm run dev)
